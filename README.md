<h2> Project Description/Purpose </h2>
<br>
Analyzing online reviews of products can help businesses improve their product offerings and identify trends in customer sentiment towards specific product lines. The purpose of this project was to analyze customer reviews from Amazon, ImDB, and Yelp, and using customer review data build a neural network model with natural language processing techniques to predict whether a customer's review has positive or negative sentiment.
